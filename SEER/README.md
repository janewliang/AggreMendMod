Male and female "All Races" life table results in the absence of other causes of death were pulled from from DevCan 6.7.8.5 for 1-year intervals and saved in this directory. We used the "SEER 21 Incidence and Mortality, 2000-2017, with Kaposi Sarcoma and Mesothelioma" database for 2015-2017 and the following cancers: All, Brain, Breast, Colorectal, Endometrial, Gastric, Hepatobiliary, Kidney, Leukemia, Melanoma, Osteosarcoma, Ovarian, Pancreatic, Prostate, SmallIntestine, SoftTissueSarcoma, Thyroid, and UrinaryBladder. The life tables were saved as files named `SEER_1517_Male_CANCER_LT.txt` and `SEER_1517_Female_CANCER_LT.txt` for males and females, respectively, and with the word `CANCER` replaced by cancer type.
